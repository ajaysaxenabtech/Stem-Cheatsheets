## Basics

### Common terms

- Ampere (A): measure of current, 1A = 1C/sec
- Charge: measured in coulumbs (C). 1C = the charge of 6.25x10^18 electrons
- Conductors: materials with low resistance, eg. copper, silver, gold
- Current (I): the amount of electrons moving past a point every second
- Electricity: the flow of electrons
- Insulators: materials with a high resistance, eg. clay, plastics
- Ohm (greek omega symbol): measure of resistance
- Ohm's law: E=IR
- Power (P): amount of work a circuit is doing.
- Resistance (R): how tightly materials hold onto electrons. Measured in ohms
- Volt (V): measure of voltage. 1V will push 1A through 1 ohm of resistance
- Voltage (E): measure of pressure pushing the electrons
- Watt (W): measure of power, P = EI
