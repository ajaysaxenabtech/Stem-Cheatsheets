## Common terms

- Analysis: the study of limits
- Sequence: strings of a number pattern
- Series: a sequence where the end result involves all the terms (eg. added up)
- Sequence of partial sums: each term is the result of the previous terms added up
- Arithmetic: the study of whole numbers and fractions
- Geometry: the study of figures in space - points, lines, curves, and n-dimensional objects
- Algebra: the use of abstract symbols to represent mathematical objects (numbers, lines, matrices, transformations), and the rules for combining these symbols
- Domain: the numbers that a function can have as arguments. e.g. the d(N) function only applies to positive integers.
- Exponential function, loosely defined: arguments go up by addition, values go up my multiplication.
- Irrational number: a number that is not a ratio of two whole numbers.
- Closed form: the exact representation of a number.
- Open form: a decimal approximation of a number.
- Pi(n): the number of primes up to and including n. pi refers to the greek letter, not the value 3.14...
- Greek epsilon: typically used to represent a very tiny positive number.
- Greek capital sigma: typically used to indicate a summation should be performed. The expressions at the top and bottom indicate range. The expression to the right indicates what is to be summed.
- Li(x): the log integral function.
- Algebraic number: a number that is a zero of some polynomial with integer coefficients.

## Power rules

- x^m * x^n = x^(m+n)
- x^m / x^n = x^(m-n)
- (x^m)^n = x^(m*n)
- x^0 = 1 (for any positive number x)
- x^-n = 1 / (x^n)
- x^(m/n) = the nth root of x^m
- (x*y)^n = x^n * y^n
- x = e^(log x) (for any positive number x)
- log(a*b) = log a + log b
- log(a^n) = n * log a
