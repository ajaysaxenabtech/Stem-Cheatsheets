## Supervised learning

Starts with training data. Data contains:

- Target variables: the columns that we want to predict
- Labels: the values of the target variable rows
- Features: the columns that the model learns from and uses to create predictions
- Examples: feature + target data

Example:

| FeatureA | FeatureB | TargetA |
| -------- | -------- | ------- |
| Data1    | Data2    | Label   |
