## Remote client access

### RDP into a Windows machine from an Ubuntu client

- Install the Remmina package with the Software Manager. It should work immediately, however the following settings should be changed:
  - Main window: toggle dynamic resolution update
  - RDP: edit good quality setting: enable all but composition. Specify good setting in connection
  - Applet: start in tray upon user login

### Configure Ubuntu for remote access

- Settings -> Power -> Screen Blank: Never
- Settings -> Sharing -> Remote Desktop -> Remote Desktop: Enabled
- Settings -> Sharing -> Remote Desktop -> Remote Control: Enabled
- Settings -> Sharing -> Remote Desktop -> User Name: same as regular login
- Settings -> Sharing -> Remote Desktop -> Password: update to regular login password
- Reboot
- When connecting from Windows, make sure 32-bit color is selected. Lower depth may fail due to bug in Windowâ€™s RDP client.
