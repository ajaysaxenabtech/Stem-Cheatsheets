## Deployment Models

### Private cloud

- For exclusive use by tenants
- Accessed via network link
- Direct control of resources and data
- Uses virtualization to offer on-demand resources
- More upfront investment

### Public cloud

- Infrastrure owned by service provider
- Internet accessible
- Easier to scale
- Less upfront investment

### Hybrid cloud

- Mix of private + public
- Useful for cloud bursting: when private cloud hits capacity, temporarily overflow to public cloud

### Multi cloud

- Mix of different service providers
- Reduces dependence on single vendor

### Community cloud

- Infrastructure shared by a specific community (e.g. an educational system)
